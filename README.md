Made as part of a 90-minute Creative Coding session at [Recurse](https://gianluca.ai/recurse-init/) with the prompt:

> AAAAAAAHHHHH!!! Scream and shout in terror and excitement. Vibrato with strength or vibrato with nervousness. Scream outside on a busy new york sidewalk or inside so deep inside you aren't sure you heard yourself but you know you know you did. You finally got where you knew you were going, or you finally admitted you'll never get there. AAAAaaaaaAAAHhhhh!!! I saw a spider! It was incredible.

I find clicking on fiddly things under time pressure to be deeply frustrating. It makes me want to go AAAAHHHH! So I followed that feeling to its logical conclusion.
